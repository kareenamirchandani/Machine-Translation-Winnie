# Winnie-Machine-Translation
This project provides translation models and introduces a pipeline for handling code-mixed Ugandan language queries, utilising multiple monolingual translators. We fine-tune OPUS-MT (mul-eng) on translation pairs from the [SALT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Sunbird/salt) and [MT560](https://opus.nlpl.eu/MT560) datasets.
